# Chat GPT 
I asked Chat GPT to generate user stories based on the additional requirements for the Address Book Challenge.

`Can you write some user stories for the following requirements?
-The user should be able to search for a contact by phone number and have the results displayed
-The user should be able to search for a contact by email address and have the results displayed
-The user should be able to search for a contact by name, phone number or email address and have the results displayed in alphabetical order
-The user should be able to delete all contacts at once, confirming that they want to do this before proceeding`

This was the response from Chat GPT:

Sure, here are some user stories based on the provided requirements:

### User Story 1: Search for a Contact by Phone Number
**As a** user,  
**I want** to search for a contact by phone number,  
**so that** I can quickly find and view the details of a contact when I have their phone number.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The user can enter a phone number in the search bar.
2. Upon entering the phone number and initiating the search, the system displays the contact(s) matching the entered phone number.
3. If no contact matches the entered phone number, the system informs the user that no results were found.

### User Story 2: Search for a Contact by Email Address
**As a** user,  
**I want** to search for a contact by email address,  
**so that** I can quickly find and view the details of a contact when I have their email address.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The user can enter an email address in the search bar.
2. Upon entering the email address and initiating the search, the system displays the contact(s) matching the entered email address.
3. If no contact matches the entered email address, the system informs the user that no results were found.

### User Story 3: Search for a Contact by Name, Phone Number, or Email Address
**As a** user,  
**I want** to search for a contact by name, phone number, or email address,  
**so that** I can quickly find and view the details of a contact based on any of these criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The user can enter a name, phone number, or email address in the search bar.
2. Upon entering the search term and initiating the search, the system displays the contact(s) matching the entered term.
3. The results are displayed in alphabetical order by the contact's name.
4. If no contact matches the entered term, the system informs the user that no results were found.

### User Story 4: Delete All Contacts at Once
**As a** user,  
**I want** to delete all contacts at once,  
**so that** I can clear my contact list quickly when needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The user has the option to select a "Delete All Contacts" action.
2. Upon selecting this action, the system prompts the user to confirm that they want to delete all contacts.
3. The user must explicitly confirm the deletion (e.g., by clicking a "Confirm" button).
4. If the user confirms the deletion, the system deletes all contacts and informs the user that the contacts have been successfully deleted.
5. If the user cancels the deletion, no contacts are deleted and the user is returned to the previous state.

These user stories provide a clear and concise way to understand the requirements and the expected functionality from a user's perspective.
