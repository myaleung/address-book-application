## Introduction
After the resounding success of the Secret Diary, DFCorp are now looking to extend their range of products and have decided to create an Address Book application. The address book will allow users to access an independent application to store their contacts in. This application will allow users to save different contacts within their address book and hold information such as their name, email address and phone number for each of their contacts. There is also a search functionality within the address book they can use to look up a specific contact. This means users can keep information for their contacts in one place and not need to search in a physical book and have to remember the information as it would be stored electronically.

### Benefits
The benefits that the software will bring to the user include,
- **Efficiency:** Users will be able to add, delete and search for contacts in their address book quickly.
- **Compact:** Information is in one place and not in different notebooks or pieces of paper.
- **Consistency:** Users will be able to find information easily and know where to look as all the entries will be constructed in the same format.
- **Ease of Use:** As all information is stored electronically, users don't need to memorise this information and can simply refer back to the software. 

### Impact
The impact that the software will have on the customer's business include,
- **New Customer Base:** A new wave of customers will benefit the business as this software will cater to a new set of customers. Therefore, different FAQs may arise and their needs differ from those who use the Secret Diary.
- **Increase Revenue:** The new software will greatly boost the company's revenue by bring a new product to the market and diversify the business' portfolio. It will also help sell this new product to existing customers.
- **Brand Recognition:** Launching this new software will help improve DFCorp's image and brand recognition.

### Risks
The risks that the software may have for the business include,
- **Data Expansion:** Although the basic information of a contact is kept there isn't a way to increase the field capacity of the address book information.
- **Software Integration:** The software is currently an app on a computer and hasn't been tested on a phone and thus may not be compatible with the phone app system to easily call contacts from. Email addresses stored on the system also aren't linked and therefore won't open an email provider to compose a message.
- **International Numbers:** Currently the software handles UK numbers and matches format of numbers to 11 digits. Therefore, it won't be able to handle international phone numbers yet.
